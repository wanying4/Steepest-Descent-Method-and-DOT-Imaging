# Steepest-Descent-Method-and-DOT-Imaging

Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) is an non-invasive optical imaging technique that measures the optical properties of physiological tissue using light in the near infrared spectrum. Optical properties are extracted from the measurement using reconstruction algorithm.

This project synthesizes measurement data by solving the 2-dimensional finite volume forward model with a set of known optical properties. This projects examines one of the reconstruction algorithms - the steepest descent method in combination with inexact line search - in the task of reconstructing the absorption profile.
